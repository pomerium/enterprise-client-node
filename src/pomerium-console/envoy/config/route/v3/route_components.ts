 *
 *  1. If the response contains the header ``Retry-After`` its value must be on
 *     the form ``120`` (an integer that represents the number of seconds to
 *     wait before retrying). If so, this value is used as the back-off interval.
 *  2. Otherwise, if the response contains the header ``X-RateLimit-Reset`` its
 *     value must be on the form ``1595320702`` (an integer that represents the
 *     point in time at which to retry, as a Unix timestamp in seconds). If so,
 *     the current time is subtracted from this value and the result is used as
 *     the back-off interval.
 *  3. Otherwise, Envoy will use the default
 *     :ref:`exponential back-off <envoy_v3_api_field_config.route.v3.RetryPolicy.retry_back_off>`
 *     strategy.
 *
 * No matter which format is used, if the resulting back-off interval exceeds
 * ``max_interval`` it is discarded and the next header in ``reset_headers``
 * is tried. If a request timeout is configured for the route it will further
 * limit how long the request will be allowed to run.
 *
 * To prevent many clients retrying at the same point in time jitter is added
 * to the back-off interval, so the resulting interval is decided by taking:
 * ``random(interval, interval * 1.5)``.
 *
 * .. attention::
 *
 *   Configuring ``rate_limited_retry_back_off`` will not by itself cause a request
 *   to be retried. You will still need to configure the right retry policy to match
